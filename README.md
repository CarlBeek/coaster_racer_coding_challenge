#coaster_racer_bot

##Overview:
This is an attempt at Sirajology's openai Universe coding [challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGYU5t8MO7s&t=11s).
It is a Q-Deep Learning model that learns the flash game CoasterRacer based on only the pixels and the score as read by Universe.

##Dependancies

* tensorflow
* cv2
* numpy
* random
* collections
* gym
* universe

##Usage:

Either run train.py to train the model or demo.py to see it in action. Demo.py requires the TensorFlow session to be fetched from: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxBNZu1wzSbkdzFpREFtcW40NVU?usp=sharing)
Note that train.py doesn't render anything and as such neeeds to be VNCd into to see whats happening.

##Credits

I got this code from ||Source|| here on github who "merely wrapped, updated and documented it" from [malreddysid](https://github.com/malreddysid) I jus poorly used this for my universe implememntation
